  <br>

<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p1>
This project was building a robot and programming it to wrestle another robot out of a zone using a new style of coding as the bricks are EV3 and I have used different software previously. I was interested in doing this as a project as I haven’t don’t robotics in a long time and I enjoyed it and got a lot out of it last time I did it. My previous experience in this is limited as I have built a robot before, yet I haven’t used this software to program it.</p1>
<h5> Objectives</h5>
<ul><li>
Build a robot that can withstand pressure.</li>
<li>
Enable the robot to turn when it reaches the edge of the fighting zone.</li>
<li>
Create an arm that hits another robot to push or unbalance it.</li>
<li>
Learn how to use Lego Mindstorms EV3 programming</li> </ul>
<h5> Results </h5>
<ul>
<li>
I successfully built a robot that can drive around in a set zone, turning when it reaches the edges and won in the test fights that Mitch and I conducted in previous lessons. </li>
<li>
I learnt how to use EV3 coding and utilised it to program my robot correctly to do the set tasks.</li>
<li>
I created a very heavy low robot with strong connections to not break on contact with the opposing robot.</li> </ul>
  


<h5>
Process and Planning </h5>
<p1>
To begin my project I brainstormed design ideas for my robot until I was happy with my idea, which ended up much longer than I expected and I ran out of places to plug in my motors and such so I had to tone down the design and only use the arm at the front to displace opposing robots. I connected the motors to the brick, cross-connecting them wherever I could to strengthen the design. I used as many of the places to connect the attachments to the brick, as it is the most stable part of the robot. 
I decided not to use any EV3 tutorials as I had previous experience in other programming software and I wanted to see if my skills were transferable to a whole new programming language. I successfully programmed my robot with a big switch in a loop, deciding what to do based on the colour that the robot drove over. <p1>
<h5>
Discussion </h5>
<p1>
Some problems that I encountered included finding the parts to build my robot as I had previously used different pieces and I didn’t know what pieces worked where, trying to connect the wheels without them drooping because my robot is heavy and the connections were not originally strong enough, and finding out what program features did what. I overcame my building problems through making small prototypes before making my actual robot so I knew what had to fit where and how to do it without having to constantly change my robot. The programming became a lot easier as I realised that when the robot was plugged in, I could see which sensors were active and what their readings were. Next time I would like to make my robot more compact and change the design so I can see the screen to select the correct program. I think I made my swinger at the front very well, connected everything together solidly and made a good, functional program. </p1>
